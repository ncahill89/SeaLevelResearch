Available at: https://doi.org/10.5334/oq.121.\nSummary: We demonstrate the utility and reproducibility of the saltmarsh foraminifera-based ‘geological tide gauge’ (GTG) approach by developing two independent records of relative sea-level (RSL) change for Dublin, Ireland. Our records, recovered from two different saltmarshes, indicate that RSL rose at a century-scale rate of 1.5 ± 0.9 mm yr–1 over the last 200 years.\n\nCheck out the paper\n\n\n\nGlobal survey shows planners use widely varying sea-level rise projections for coastal adaptation\n\nCitation: Hirschfeld, D., Behar, D., Nicholls, R.J., Cahill, N. et al. Global survey shows planners use widely varying sea-level rise projections for coastal adaptation.

The model provides a standardized approach to hydroclimate reconstruction using multiple palaeoclimate proxy records derived from natural archives such as speleothems, ice cores and tree rings. The method combines time-series modeling with inverse prediction to quantify the relationships between a given hydroclimate index and relevant proxies over an instrumental period and subsequently reconstruct the hydroclimate back through time.\n\nCheck out the paper"

A scalable Bayesian spatiotemporal model for water level predictions using a nearest neighbor Gaussian process approach (Version 2). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06934\nSummary: A scalable Bayesian model for predicting river water levels across space and time. The model enables accurate and efficient forecasting by leveraging a Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) framework, designed to handle large datasets. It incorporates spatial and temporal structure while addressing the computational challenges of standard Gaussian Processes. The method applies to daily river level observations from multiple monitoring stations, providing both future predictions and spatial interpolations at unmeasured locations. Uncertainty is quantified through the Bayesian framework.\n\nCheck out the paper\n\n\nA Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model with physical barriers for extreme sea-level prediction in Ireland\n\nCitation: Mayer, F. P. & Cahill, N. (2025). A Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model with physical barriers for extreme sea-level prediction in Ireland. Environmetrics. Under review.\nSummary: This paper develops a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model to estimate extreme sea levels in Ireland, using data from 26 Irish tide gauges and 21 from the West coast of Great Britain. Annual maxima (1961–2021) are modelled with the blended Generalised Extreme Value (bGEV) distribution, incorporating spatial dependence via a Matérn correlation and coastline barriers through the SPDE approach, while temporal trends are captured with a random walk. Predictions at ungauged sites are made using a coastal mesh. Results show rising extreme sea levels, with the East coast most at risk. The model better reflects coastal processes, supporting flood risk management and policymaking."
