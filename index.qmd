**ExStrEAms** is a curated collection of tools and interactive applications developed as part of ongoing research into extreme sea level and storm surge events, with a focus on Ireland and the surrounding coastal regions. These resources are intended to support climate resilience and coastal risk assessments.

## Interactive Tools

### [Ireland Surge Analysis Tool](https://sealevelresearch.shinyapps.io/IrelandSurge/)

This interactive app enables users to: 

- Visualize sea level surges across Irish coastal locations. 

- Apply statistical methods for extreme value analysis using the `extRemes` R package. 

- Estimate return levels and exceedance frequencies.

### [geslaR Data Viewer & Analysis Tool](https://sealevelresearch.shinyapps.io/geslaR-app/)

An interactive app built on the [`geslaR`](https://eireextremes.github.io/geslaR/) package for exploring and analyzing the GESLA dataset.

Key features: 

- Visual exploration of tide gauge records from the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis (GESLA) project. 

- Filtering by station metadata and data quality indicators.

- Download location specific data for further analysis.

### Two Centuries of Relative Sea-Level Rise in Dublin, Ireland

- **Citation:** Roseby, Z.A., Southall, K., Alvarez-Agoues, F., Cahill, N., McCarthy, G.D. and Edwards, R.J. (2023) ‘Two Centuries of Relative Sea-Level Rise in Dublin, Ireland, Reconstructed by Geological Tide Gauge’, Open Quaternary, 9(1), p. 3. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5334/oq.121.

- **Summary:** We demonstrate the utility and reproducibility of the saltmarsh foraminifera-based ‘geological tide gauge’ (GTG) approach by developing two independent records of relative sea-level (RSL) change for Dublin, Ireland. Our records, recovered from two different saltmarshes, indicate that RSL rose at a century-scale rate of 1.5 ± 0.9 mm yr–1 over the last 200 years.

### Global survey shows planners use widely varying sea-level rise projections for coastal adaptation

- **Citation:** Hirschfeld, D., Behar, D., Nicholls, R.J., Cahill, N. et al. Global survey shows planners use widely varying sea-level rise projections for coastal adaptation. Commun Earth Environ 4, 102 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00703-x

- **Summary:** Including sea-level rise (SLR) projections in planning and implementing coastal adaptation is crucial. Here we analyze the first global survey on the use of SLR projections for 2050 and 2100. Two-hundred and fifty-three coastal practitioners engaged in adaptation/planning from 49 countries provided complete answers to the survey which was distributed in nine languages – Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. While recognition of the threat of SLR is almost universal, only 72% of respondents currently utilize SLR projections. Generally, developing countries have lower levels of utilization. There is no global standard in the use of SLR projections: for locations using a standard data structure, 53% are planning using a single projection, while the remainder are using multiple projections, with 13% considering a low-probability high-end scenario. Countries with histories of adaptation and consistent national support show greater assimilation of SLR projections into adaptation decisions. This research provides new insights about current planning practices and can inform important ongoing efforts on the application of the science that is essential to the promotion of effective adaptation.

### A Bayesian time series model for reconstructing hydroclimate 

- **Citation:** Cahill, N., Croke, J., Campbell, M., Hughes, K., Vitkovsky, J., Kilgallen, J. E., & Parnell, A. (2023). A Bayesian time series model for reconstructing hydroclimate from multiple proxies. Environmetrics, 34(4), e2786. https://doi.org/10.1002/env.2786

- **Summary:** A Bayesian model which produces probabilistic reconstructions of hydroclimatic variability.The model provides a standardized approach to hydroclimate reconstruction using multiple palaeoclimate proxy records derived from natural archives such as speleothems, ice cores and tree rings. The method combines time-series modeling with inverse prediction to quantify the relationships between a given hydroclimate index and relevant proxies over an instrumental period and subsequently reconstruct the hydroclimate back through time.

### A scalable Bayesian spatiotemporal model for water level predictions using a nearest neighbor Gaussian process approach

- **Citation:** Nagahama, V. H., Sweeney, J., & Cahill, N. (2025). A scalable Bayesian spatiotemporal model for water level predictions using a nearest neighbor Gaussian process approach (Version 2). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06934

- **Summary:** A scalable Bayesian model for predicting river water levels across space and time. The model enables accurate and efficient forecasting by leveraging a Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP) framework, designed to handle large datasets. It incorporates spatial and temporal structure while addressing the computational challenges of standard Gaussian Processes. The method applies to daily river level observations from multiple monitoring stations, providing both future predictions and spatial interpolations at unmeasured locations. Uncertainty is quantified through the Bayesian framework.
